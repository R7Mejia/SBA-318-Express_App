# Structure of the localhost URL:

1. > / < = *homepage*
2. > /about < >= *opens the about page*
3. > /images/Messi.jpeg = *opens the player's image* **(Notice also that this can easily work better if the player's name is clicked directly in the *about section*)**
4. > /players = *shows all the players in json format*
5. > /players/(10, 7, 4, 5) = *any of those numbers will individually display the player information. If a different number is displayed, an **'error message'** will be displayed*
