## Structure of the localhost URL:
1. > /  = *homepage*
2. > /about = *opens the about page*
3. > /images/Messi.jpeg = *opens the player's image* **(Notice also that this can easily work better if the player's name is clicked directly in the *about section*)**
4. > /players = *shows all the players in json format*
5. > /players/(10, 7, 4, 5, 8) = *any of those numbers will individually display the player information. If a different number is displayed, an **'error message'** will be displayed*

# IMPLEMENTING CRUD
I am just gonna stick to the sugestions and just use three of the four CRUD methods:
### 1. POST
I've created a new player via POST, and dinamically add it to the array(players.js) using **POSTMAN** and the POST method

### 2. DELETE
In a similar way, I have successfully deleted a player using the delete method and implementing POSTMAN as a tool to perdorm that task
### 3. GET 
Obviously used to make the app work?

# IMAGES
I've created the players' images using AI

# TEMPLATES
I believe I have used both *view (html)* and *engine (ejs)* templates...

**So, that being said, I trust I have ==completed== all of the SBA ==Requirements==**
